### üß† PyTorch Concepts ‚Äì Understanding the Machine Learning Process

#### 1. **What is a model in machine learning?**

Try to explain what a model is, like you were telling a friend. What does it do?

#### 2. **What does it mean to ‚Äútrain‚Äù a model?**

In your own words, describe what‚Äôs happening when a computer is training on data.

#### 3. **What are the steps in the training process?**

List or describe the main steps in order - for example: give the model some data, check how well it does, and so on.

#### 4. **Why do we need to measure how well the model is doing?**

How do we know if the model is learning or not?

#### 5. **What is the loss function, and why is it important?**

Try to explain what a ‚Äúloss‚Äù is in simple terms. Why is it something we want to make smaller?

#### 6. **What does the optimizer do?**

Imagine the optimizer as a helper during training - what do you think its job is?

#### 7. **Why can‚Äôt the model get everything right the first time?**

Why does the model need to try many times (many *epochs*) before it gets good?

#### 8. **What is a learning rate, and why is tuning it important?**

Try to explain what the learning rate controls. What happens if it‚Äôs too high or too low?

#### 9. **What kinds of functions or properties does a PyTorch model need to have to learn?**

Think back the the example LinearModel class we worked through - how does it work?

#### 10. **If your model isn‚Äôt getting better, what are some things you might try to change?**

Can you think of any ways to help the model improve if it‚Äôs not learning well?
